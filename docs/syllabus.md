# Course Syllabus

## Agentic Artificial Intelligence
**Course Code:** AAI-PhD
**Semester:** Spring 2025
**Credits:** 6 ECTS
**Format:** Weekly lectures + hands-on labs

---

## Course Description

This doctoral-level course provides a comprehensive introduction to agentic artificial intelligence - autonomous systems that leverage large language models to reason, plan, use tools, and collaborate. Students will learn both theoretical foundations and practical implementation skills.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, students will be able to:

1. **Design** agent architectures for complex reasoning tasks
2. **Implement** tool-using agents with multiple LLM providers
3. **Build** multi-agent systems with effective coordination
4. **Evaluate** agent performance using standard benchmarks
5. **Apply** safety measures to prevent hallucinations
6. **Create** domain-specific agents for real-world applications

## Prerequisites

- Strong Python programming skills
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Basic understanding of transformer architectures
- Ability to read and understand research papers

## Required Materials

- Access to OpenAI or Anthropic API (student credits available)
- Python 3.11+ development environment
- GitHub account for coursework submission
