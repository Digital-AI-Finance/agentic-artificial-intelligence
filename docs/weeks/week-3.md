## Exercise

Build a multi-tool agent that can:
1. Search the web for information
2. Perform calculations
3. Look up weather data
4. Decide which tool to use based on the query

## Discussion Questions

1. How do OpenAI and Anthropic function calling APIs differ?
2. What makes a good tool description?
3. How should agents handle tool errors?
