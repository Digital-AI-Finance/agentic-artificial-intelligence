## Exercise

Build an adaptive RAG system that:
1. Decides when retrieval is needed
2. Evaluates retrieval quality
3. Corrects poor retrievals
4. Generates grounded responses

## Discussion Questions

1. How does Self-RAG decide when to retrieve?
2. What makes CRAG's corrective approach effective?
3. When should you use hierarchical vs. flat retrieval?
