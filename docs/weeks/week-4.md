## Exercise

Implement a Reflexion agent that:
1. Attempts coding problems
2. Reflects on failures
3. Improves based on self-generated feedback
4. Tracks learning across attempts

## Discussion Questions

1. How does verbal reflection compare to gradient-based learning?
2. What makes a good reflection prompt?
3. When does Reflexion help vs. hurt performance?
