## Key Concepts

**Field Evolution**:
- 2022: Foundation (CoT prompting, RLHF alignment)
- 2023: Emergence (ReAct, Reflexion, Generative Agents)
- 2024: Production (Claude Computer Use, GraphRAG)
- 2025+: World models, embodied agents, long-horizon planning

**Open Research Problems**:
- **Capability Gaps**: Long-horizon planning, world modeling, compositional generalization
- **Safety/Alignment**: Scalable oversight, goal stability, corrigibility
- **Infrastructure**: Evaluation benchmarks, scalable memory

**Generative Agents**: Simulated personas maintaining identity, memories, plans, and relationships. Enable computational social science experiments.

**World Models**: Internal representations of environment dynamics enabling mental simulation before acting.

## Final Project Presentations

Students present their research projects on agentic AI topics.

## Exercise

Write a research proposal for an open problem in agentic AI:
1. Identify a meaningful, tractable problem
2. Review related work and current approaches
3. Propose a novel approach with clear methodology
4. Design evaluation methodology and success metrics
5. Assess feasibility and potential impact

## Discussion Questions

1. What are the most important open problems in agentic AI?
2. How do we ensure agent safety as capabilities scale?
3. What governance structures are needed for autonomous agents?
4. Will agents with persistent world models emerge in the next 5 years?
5. What role will multi-agent emergence play in future systems?

## Final Project Directions

- Novel agent architecture for a specific domain
- Improved evaluation methodology for agent systems
- Safety or alignment technique for autonomous agents
- Multi-agent coordination mechanism
