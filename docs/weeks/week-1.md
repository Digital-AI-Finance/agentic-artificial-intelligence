## Exercise

Build a basic ReAct agent from scratch that can:

2. Perform calculations using a calculator tool
3. Show the complete thought-action-observation trajectory

## Discussion Questions

1. What distinguishes an AI agent from a standard LLM application?
2. How does the ReAct paradigm improve over pure Chain-of-Thought?
3. What are the limitations of current agent architectures?
