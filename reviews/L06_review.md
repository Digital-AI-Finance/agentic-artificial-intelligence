## Chart Issues

| Chart Folder | Issue | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| 01_framework_comparison | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 02_langgraph_flow | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 03_state_management | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 04_orchestration_patterns | Used in slides - compliant | None |

**Note**: L06 is the first lecture where ALL chart folders are used in slides.

## Pedagogical Notes

- Learning objectives well-structured using Bloom's taxonomy (all 6 levels)
- Good use of \bottomnote for key takeaways on every slide
- Excellent framework comparison table on slide 12
- Production deployment slide (11) is highly practical
- Clear evolution narrative: 1st gen -> 2nd gen -> Enterprise
- Clarifications in parentheses are helpful: "(state snapshots)", "(flow control)", etc.
- Framework selection table provides clear decision guidance
- All 4 charts effectively illustrate key concepts

## Recommended Changes

1. None - this lecture is well-structured with all charts used

## Cross-Lecture Issues

- AutoGen referenced from L05 - appropriate continuation
- LangGraph state management connects to memory in L04
- Production patterns connect to evaluation in L10
- RAG mention connects to L07 coming next
