## Chart Issues

| Chart Folder | Issue | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| 01_hallucination_types | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 02_verification_pipeline | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 03_factscore | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 04_mitigation_strategies | Used in slides - compliant | None |

**Note**: All 4 chart folders are used in slides.

## Pedagogical Notes

- Learning objectives well-structured using Bloom's taxonomy (all 6 levels)
- Good use of \bottomnote for key takeaways on every slide
- Excellent taxonomy of hallucination types: factual, faithfulness, instruction
- Clarifications in parentheses are helpful: "(fabricated content)", "(anchor to sources)", "(favoring initial beliefs)"
- CoVe four-step process is clearly explained with emphasis on independence
- FActScore example with Einstein makes concept concrete
- "Prevention > Detection > Correction" principle is memorable
- Practical implementation guidelines on slide 13 are actionable
- Trade-offs section provides balanced guidance

## Recommended Changes

1. None - this lecture is well-structured with all charts used

## Cross-Lecture Issues

- Grounding connects to RAG from L07
- Multi-agent review connects to L05 architectures
- Tool use for facts connects to L03
- Detection methods connect to evaluation in L10
- "LLM-as-judge" introduced here, used in L10
