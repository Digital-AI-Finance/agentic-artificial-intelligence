# L12 Review: Research Frontiers

## Summary
- **Slides**: 15
- **Charts**: 4 (research_timeline, open_problems, safety_challenges, future_directions)
- **Overall Quality**: A+

## Content Issues

| Slide | Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|-------|----------|-----|
| 13 | Sumers et al. citation missing arXiv ID | Low | Add arXiv:2309.02427 (NOT 2403.12897) |

## Citation Verification

| Citation | Verified | Issue |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Wang et al. (2023) arXiv:2305.16291 | Y | Correct - Voyager embodied agent |
| Park et al. (2023) arXiv:2304.03442 | Y | Correct - Generative Agents |
| Bai et al. (2022) arXiv:2212.08073 | Y | Correct - Constitutional AI |
| Xi et al. (2023) arXiv:2309.07864 | Y | Correct - LLM Agent Survey |
| Sumers et al. (2024) | Y | Missing arXiv - use 2309.02427 |

## Chart Issues

| Chart Folder | Issue | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| 01_research_timeline | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 02_open_problems | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 03_safety_challenges | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 04_future_directions | Used in slides - compliant | None |

**Note**: All 4 chart folders are used in slides.

## Pedagogical Notes

- Learning objectives well-structured using Bloom's taxonomy (all 6 levels)
- Good use of \bottomnote for key takeaways on every slide
- Excellent historical timeline: Foundation (2022) -> Emergence (2023) -> Production (2024)
- Three-tier research problem taxonomy: Capability Gaps, Safety, Infrastructure
- Generative Agents architecture explained: memory stream, retrieval, reflection, planning
- Future directions organized by timeframe: Near-term/Medium-term/Long-term
- Course summary slide effectively synthesizes 12-week journey
- Term definitions provided: embodied agent, generative agent, world model
- Constitutional AI properly attributed to Anthropic
- Voyager example grounds embodied agent concept

## Recommended Changes

1. **[LOW]** Add arXiv:2309.02427 to Sumers et al. citation on slide 13

## Cross-Lecture Issues

- Course summary synthesizes all 11 previous lectures
- Safety/alignment connects to Constitutional AI from L09
- World models connect to planning strategies from L04
- Generative Agents memory connects to agent memory from L04
- Evaluation gap connects to benchmarks from L10
- Voyager connects to embodied agent concept
- Agent formula "LLM + Memory + Tools + Planning + Evaluation" encapsulates course
