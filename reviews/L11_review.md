## Chart Issues

| Chart Folder | Issue | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| 01_application_domains | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 02_code_agents | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 03_finance_agents | Used in slides - compliant | None |
| 04_healthcare_agents | Used in slides - compliant | None |

**Note**: All 4 chart folders are used in slides.

## Pedagogical Notes

- Learning objectives well-structured using Bloom's taxonomy (all 6 levels)
- Good use of \bottomnote for key takeaways on every slide
- Excellent domain comparison across code, finance, and healthcare
- Clear maturity hierarchy: high (code) -> medium (finance) -> emerging (healthcare)
- Flow engineering definition provided: "(structured pipelines)"
- Human-in-the-loop intensity gradation is practical guidance
- Cross-domain design patterns table on slide 13 synthesizes key differences
- Regulatory considerations properly emphasized for finance and healthcare
- Production systems mentioned (Copilot, Cursor, Devin, Claude Code)

## Recommended Changes

1. None - this lecture is well-structured with all charts used

## Cross-Lecture Issues

- SWE-bench from L10 evaluation applied here
- Flow engineering connects to planning strategies from L04
- Compliance awareness connects to hallucination prevention from L09
- Code agent architectures build on frameworks from L06
- ReAct mentioned in FinAgent - from L01
