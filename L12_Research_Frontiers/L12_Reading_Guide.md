## Discussion Questions

### For Seminar
1. **Emergence**: What conditions enable emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems? Can we predict or control emergence?

2. **Safety at Scale**: How do we ensure safety as agents become more capable? What new risks emerge?

3. **Grounding**: How can agents develop grounded world models rather than relying on language patterns?

4. **Autonomy vs. Control**: What is the right balance between agent autonomy and human oversight?

5. **Research Priorities**: What are the most important open problems for the field to address?
