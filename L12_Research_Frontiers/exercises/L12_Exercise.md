# Week 12 Exercise: Research Proposal for Agentic AI

## Objective
Write a research proposal identifying an open problem in agentic AI and proposing a novel approach to address it.

## Learning Outcomes
- Identify meaningful open research problems
- Synthesize literature to position contribution
- Design experimental methodology
- Articulate research impact and significance

## Task Description

### Part 1: Problem Identification (25%)
Select an open problem from:
- Agent coordination and communication
- Long-horizon planning with uncertainty
- Grounded world models for agents
- Agent safety and alignment
- Emergent behaviors in multi-agent systems
- Agent learning and adaptation
- Human-agent collaboration
- Tool creation and meta-learning

Write a problem statement that:
1. Defines the problem precisely
2. Explains why it matters
3. Reviews current approaches and limitations
4. Identifies specific gaps in the literature

### Part 2: Proposed Approach (30%)
Describe your proposed solution:
1. High-level methodology
2. Key technical innovations
3. Architecture or algorithm design
4. Theoretical foundations (if applicable)

### Part 3: Experimental Design (25%)
Plan your evaluation:
1. Research questions and hypotheses
2. Datasets or environments
3. Baselines for comparison
4. Evaluation metrics
5. Expected results and success criteria

### Part 4: Impact and Timeline (20%)
Articulate significance:
1. Contributions to the field
2. Potential applications
3. Risks and limitations
4. Future directions

## Deliverables
1. `proposal.pdf` - 6-8 page research proposal
2. `literature_review.md` - Annotated bibliography (10+ papers)
3. `slides.pdf` - 10-minute presentation slides
4. `prototype.py` (optional) - Proof-of-concept code
